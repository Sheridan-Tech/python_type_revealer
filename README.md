# python_type_revealer
A python library that identifies types, even those currently stored as another type. I have plans to elaborate on this later. 

Tested on a system running Python 2.7.6 


Identifies:
int
str
float
str with comma
negative numbers
bool
alphanumeric strings
empty fields with space chars
None type
